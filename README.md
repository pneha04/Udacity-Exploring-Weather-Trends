# Udacity-Exploring-Weather-Trends
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.
I have already queried and saved the data in results.csv file. 
The file contains Global Temperature Data and Local (Bangalore, India) Temperature data.
I have also created a document listing all my steps and the conclusions after analysing the dataset.
